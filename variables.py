#Assignment, data-types, ASCII character set, arithmetic expressions
"""Variables- 
points to the value that is stored in memory
reserve some space in the memory
allocates memory and makes a decision to store a particular data type
stored by assigning different data types to the variables
dynamically typed
interpreted during runtime: need not provide a type to variable name

Rules-
reserved key words cannot be used for naming variables
begin with _,$, or a letter
can be in lower case and uppercase
cannot start with a number
white space characters are not allowed

Data Types- numbers, strings, tuples, list, dictionary

Numeric Data Types- Integers, Long Integers, Floating Point Numbers, Complex Numbers

Integers include 0, positive and negative whole numbers

Initializtion/Variable Definition - interpreter checks the expression on the right hand side of the 
assignment operatior then binds the value with its variable name

Integer DT ranges from: -2^31 to (2^31-1)

Floating Point Numbers- certain places after the decimal point
range: -10 to 10^3088
16 digits of precision

Ways to write- ordinary decimal notation or scientific notation(used for large numbers)

Syntax for complex numbers(real & imaginary)
<variable name>=complex(x,y)
<variable name>=x+yj

Boolean syntax
<variable name>=<'True' or 'False'>

String syntax
<variable name>=String sequence>

String Data Types- contiguous sequence of Unicode characters
single quotes or double quotes can be used

ASCII Character Set - American Standard Code for Information Interchange

Ord()- Converts character value to ASCII code
ex. ord("A") - 65
Chr()- ASCII to character
ex. chr(76) - 'L'

Arithmetic Expressions
** - Exponent, power calculations on operators
* - multiplications, multiplies value on either side of the operator
/ - division
% - modulus
+ - add, - subtract

Rules - BODMAS
Bracket Of Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction

Precedence - Exponent, Unary Negation, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Addition, Subtraction

Mixed Mode Arithmetic - integer and floating points
each operand is of a different data typpe
resulting value i.e float is of the more general type
11/2 - 5
11/2.0 - 11.0
